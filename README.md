Python and Git/Github Assignment

This assignment's goal is to gain practical experience of Python and Git/Github. GitHub public repository https://github.com/L00179359/Python has been created.
A public repository on GitHub is open to the public, meaning that anyone can view the repository, access its source code, and contribute to it. Public repositories are often used for open-source projects, where developers collaborate on a project and make their code freely available for others to use, modify, and contribute to.

In this repository we have push the Python code exercises which is done during the semester.

One new branch (new_branch_23_DEC) also created inside main branch. All the data in main branch is copy in new branch as soon as new branch get created.
We do required changes in code in new branch and once validate can merge new branch code in main branch.
