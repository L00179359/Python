Python and Git/Github Assignment

This assignment's goal is to gain practical experience of Python and Git/Github. GitHub public repository https://github.com/L00179359/Python has been created.

In this repository we have push the Python code exercises which is done during the semester.

One new branch (new_branch_23_DEC) also created inside main branch. All the data in main branch is copy in new branch as soon as new branch get created.
We do required changes in code in new branch and once validated, updated code from new branch will merge in main branch.
